This repository now hosts the early build of a travel-planning website called **Dream Destinations Travel**.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Main landing page with highlights, featured destinations, a sample itinerary, and a consultation request form.
- `styles.css` – Styling for the travel website, including responsive layout rules.
- `hello.txt` – Legacy sample file kept for testing workflows.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the travel website prototype.
3. Adjust the content or styles to tailor the experience to your travel brand.

## Next Steps
- Integrate form handling to capture consultation requests.
- Add additional destination pages and photo galleries.
- Localize the content for key target markets.
